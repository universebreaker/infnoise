Entropy = 7.999927 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2500000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2500000 samples is 251.62, and randomly
would exceed this value 54.81 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5099 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.139464223 (error 0.07 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000109 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
