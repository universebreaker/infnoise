Entropy = 7.999930 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2500000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2500000 samples is 241.53, and randomly
would exceed this value 71.82 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5109 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141317026 (error 0.01 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000411 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
