Entropy = 7.999931 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2500000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2500000 samples is 237.53, and randomly
would exceed this value 77.71 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5666 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.138763422 (error 0.09 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000239 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
