Entropy = 7.999932 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2500000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2500000 samples is 234.60, and randomly
would exceed this value 81.56 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5298 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.138216221 (error 0.11 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000632 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
