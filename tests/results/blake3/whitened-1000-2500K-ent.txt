Entropy = 7.999920 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2500000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2500000 samples is 278.34, and randomly
would exceed this value 15.09 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4031 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.144955432 (error 0.11 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000369 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
