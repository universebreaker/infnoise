Entropy = 7.259075 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2500000 byte file by 9 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2500000 samples is 1874833.84, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 128.9904 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.406901451 (error 8.45 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.005527 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
