Entropy = 7.999922 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2500000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2500000 samples is 271.14, and randomly
would exceed this value 23.28 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4963 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.138648222 (error 0.09 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000573 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
