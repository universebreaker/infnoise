Entropy = 7.999931 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2500000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2500000 samples is 239.78, and randomly
would exceed this value 74.48 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5087 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.143477030 (error 0.06 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000190 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
