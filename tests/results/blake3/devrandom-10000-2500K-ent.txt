Entropy = 7.999926 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2500000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2500000 samples is 256.18, and randomly
would exceed this value 46.74 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4480 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142603428 (error 0.03 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000651 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
